# Samyuth's React Tutorial

## Installation

Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

If you would like to start fresh, run the following command.
```
npx create-react-app example
```

For this tutorial however it is reccomended that you can checkout the starting point branch and install from there as you run through the rest of the project. The hacking branch has some small changes see [commit]() to look at the differences if you are curious. All that was removed were some unnecessary files.
```
git checkout e617c6202de1a0282bd1081bc0393bbed48c0cdc
cd example
npm ci
```

Extra tips:
* I would strongly reccomend getting syntax highlighting and linting. The editor I use is VSCode and I haven't run into any problems with [this](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dsznajder.es7-react-js-snippets) extension.
* If you would like to know more about installation, whether it be in adding react to already existing projects, or installing more powerful frameworks server side frameworks like Next.js see https://react.dev/learn/installation.
